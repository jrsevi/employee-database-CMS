# employee-database-CMS

This is an application I made using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL that will track a companies departments, roles, and employees.

## Installation

!! Install node.js and mysql to local device !!
Clone repository to local machine, and open mysql in your terminal. Run SOURCE db/schema.sql to create database. If you wish to load the database with starter data, run SOURCE db/seeds.sql. Quit out of mysql, and run node index.js in the terminal and scroll through the database options using the up and down and arrow keys.
